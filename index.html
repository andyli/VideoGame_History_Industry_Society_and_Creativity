The objective here is to add meaning to the game elements such that the gameplay is concrete, logical and easy to understand. You should explicitly state what the game elements are in the story (e.g. players are hunters, and the pool of cards is the forest which the cards are monsters etc.).</p><p>You may alter the game in any way you want to better fit the story. For example, you may assign roles to the players that each of them has different rules to follow. You are encouraged to design graphics for the cards.</p><p>In the report, introduce the game, including the name, the gameplay and the story. You should assume the reader doesn't know "Go Fish!". It should be less than 1500 words, typed in English in complete sentences.

The player experience goal of the game is to learn or master a subject in a playful and creative way. The subject can be acadamic related (e.g. periodic table) or not (e.g. how to use chopsticks). You should mention the target platform (e.g. PC/XBox/3DS/arcade machine...) and the required hardware (e.g. keyboard/webcam/game pad...).</p><p>There is no need to design every detail of the game, but the report should include a brief overview of game rules, game mechanics and any feature that you think is interesting or significant. Design at least one "screenshot" of the gameplay.

That is, unless it is an online/mobile game, it should be contained by a game box, together with game instruction, and all necessary elements (may be game board, cards, installation dics.). In the case of video game, the game should be complete and playable on a modern computer with common input device. You may use any commerial or free library, game engine or level editor.</p><p>Record all design process. It includes: Take photos of game prototypes; write down comments and review of play test sections; list out source of any media reference/style guide.</p><p>You will present the game during the last lesson: 2014-04-17</p><p>Presentation slides (with optional seperated report, if the slides does not contain everything) should be submitted to me via email in pdf format, within 1 week after the presentation.</p><p>Late submission will result in a one letter grade deduction (e.g. from A- to B-).
